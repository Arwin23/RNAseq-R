RNAseq analysis in R
====================

This workshop was first taught
[here](http://combine-australia.github.io/2016-05-11-RNAseq/).

Some of these materials are adapted from the
[R-novice-gapminder](https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/),
while subsequent materials were derived from X,
with substantial new additions from X, Y, Z.

These lesson materials are designed to be run *after* a complete introduction
to R course (e.g. SWC or DC) or equivalent background knowledge.

## Contributing

Please see the current list of [issues][] for ideas for contributing to this
repository, and the [guidelines and instructions for contributing][contrib].

When editing topic pages, you should change the source R Markdown file.
Afterwards you can render the pages by running `make preview` from the base of
the repository. Building the rendered page with the Makefile requires
installing some dependencies first. In addition to the dependencies listed in
the [lesson template documentation][dependencies], you also need to install the
R package [knitr][].

Once you've made your edits and looked over the rendered html files, you should
add, commit, and push **only the source R Markdown file(s)** to your fork, and
then open a pull request. The repository  maintainers will run the html
generation process once the pull request has been merged. You can learn more
about the design of the build process [here][design].

## Getting Help
