## Introduction to RStudio

We'll be using RStudio: a free, open source R integrated development
environment. It provides a built in editor, works on all platforms (including
on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version
control and project management.

**Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

  * The interactive R console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.

## Work flow within RStudio
There are two main ways one can work within RStudio.

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into
a .R file to run later.
   *  This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
   *  It quickly becomes laborious
2. Start writing in an .R file and use RStudio's command / short cut
to push current line, selected lines or modified lines to the
interactive R console.
   * This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
   * You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio
   or using R's `source()`  function.

## Your RStudio environment

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive
console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script
file. This console in RStudio is the same as the one you would get if
you just typed in `R` in your commandline environment.

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
obtaining a package written by someone else. As of this writing, there
are over 7,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive
network). R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`

For this workshop we will also be using packages from
These can all be obtained from Bioconductor.

Open RStudio and run the following commands to install packages from [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/). These are installed slightly differently. For example, to install the package `limma`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("limma")
```

## RStudio project management

The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects
start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and
eventually everything is a bit mixed together.

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

![](fig/bad_layout.png)

There are many reasons why we should *ALWAYS* avoid this:

1. It is really hard to tell which version of your data is
the original and which is the modified;
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various
extensions together;
3. It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find
things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code
that has been used to generate it;

A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:

* It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
* It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else
(a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
* It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
* It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.

## A possible solution

Fortunately, there are tools and packages which can help you manage your work effectively.

One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its project management
functionality. We'll be using this today to create a self-contained, reproducible
project.


> ## Challenge: Creating a self-contained project {.challenge}
>
> We're going to create a new project in RStudio:
>
> 1. Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
> 2. Click "New Directory".
> 3. Click "Empty Project".
> 4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. "my_project", or better yet use the name of this workshop.
> 5. Click the "Create Project" button.
>

Now when we start R in this project directory, or open this project with RStudio,
all of our work on this project will be entirely self-contained in this directory.

## Best practices for project organisation

Although there is no "best" way to lay out a project, there are some general
principles to adhere to that will make project management easier:

## Treat data as read only

This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. Data is
typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working with them
interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they can be modified means you are never
sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection.
It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as "read-only".

## Data Cleaning

In many cases your data will be "dirty": it will need significant preprocessing
to get into a format R (or any other programming language) will find useful. This
task is sometimes called "data munging". I find it useful to store these scripts
in a separate folder, and create a second "read-only" data folder to hold the
"cleaned" data sets.

## Treat generated output as disposable

Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should
all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.

There are lots of different was to manage this output. I find it useful to
have an output folder with different sub-directories for each separate
analysis. This makes it easier later, as many of my analyses are exploratory
and don't end up being used in the final project, and some of the analyses
get shared between projects.


## Separate function definition and application

The most effective way I find to work in R, is to play around in the interactive
session, then copy commands across to a script file when I'm sure they work and
do what I want. You can also save all the commands you've entered using the
`history` command, but I don't find it useful because when I'm typing its 90%
trial and error.

When your project is new and shiny, the script file usually contains many lines
of directly executed code. As it matures, reusable chunks get pulled into their
own functions. It's a good idea to separate these into separate folders; one
to store useful functions that you'll reuse across analyses and projects, and
one to store the analysis scripts.

## Save the data in the data directory

Now we have a good directory structure we will now place/save the data file in the `data/` directory.

Download the RNAseq data for this workshop.

> 1. Create a `/data` directory. In the bottom right panel select the "Files" tab,
then "New Folder", then type "data" and click "OK".
> 2. Download the RNAseq data using the links above (if you find the internet is slow, you can just download Day 1 for now).
> 3. Click "Download all" (this will download a zip file).
> 4. Unzip the file (usually double clicking on it will do the trick).
> 5. Move all the files inside into the `data/` folder within your project.

## Reading data into R

```{r}
# Read the data into R
seqdata <- read.delim("data/GSE60450_Lactation-GenewiseCounts.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# Read the sample information into R
targets <- read.delim("data/targets.txt")
```

```{r}
head(seqdata)
dim(seqdata)
```

## Working with Data Frames

```{r}
seqdata_sample = seqdata[1:4, 1:4]
print(seqdata_sample)

#names(seqdata_sample)[3:6] <- c("sample1", "sample2", "sample3", "sample4")
#print(seqdata_sample)

str(seqdata_sample)
```

## Data types

There are 5 main types: doubles, integers, complex, logical and character.

```
typeof(3.14)
typeof(1L)
typeof(1+1i)
typeof(TRUE)
typeof('banana')
```

Note the `L` suffix to insist that a number is an integer. No matter how complicated our analyses become, all data in R is interpreted as one of these basic data types.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cats.df <- data.frame(coat = c("calico", "black", "tabby"),
                      weight = c(2.1, 5.0, 3.2),
                      likes_string = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
write.csv(cats.df, "data/feline-data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

## Factors

```{r}
targets <- read.delim("data/targets.txt")
print(targets)
str(targets)
```

```{r}
targets <- read.delim("data/targets.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(targets)
```

```{r}
targets <- read.delim("data/targets.txt")
str(targets)
```

```{r}
targets$Status
```

```{r}
factor(targets$Status, levels = c("virgin", "pregnant", "lactate"), ordered = TRUE)
```

## Subsetting using logical statements

```{r}
targets$CellType
```

```{r}
targets$CellType == "luminal"
```

```{r}
targets$CellType[targets$CellType == "luminal"]
```

```{r}
targets[targets$CellType == "luminal",]
```
